        <h2 class="subheading marginless">Solid fuel: wood or multi-fuel?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Wood burners are recommended if you intend to burn only wood in your stove. These stoves offer a larger fire box, a solid flat base to build, an ash base for the better burning of wood and an air inlet from above for combustion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Multi-fuel stoves are recommended if you would like to burn fuels other than wood, including smokeless coals and eco-friendly hardwood briquette's which are a by-product from the timber industry. These fuels burn best when they are raised as this allows air to be drawn in from underneath the stove to facilitate combustion. The riddling grate allows the ash created during the burning process to be dispersed into an ash pan underneath the grate.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading marginless">What size stove do I need? What are kilowatts?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">To achieve the desired temperature of 21 degrees in your room, you require 1kW of heat per 14 cubic metres of space. Therefore to calculate the optimum kW output your stove requires, multiply the room's length by its height, its width and then divide the total by 14. This will be calculated as part of the initial survey carried out and will be discussed with you.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading marginless">Air vents.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">HETAS and building regulations state as a requirement, all stoves above 5kW have a permanently open source of air from outside, i.e. an air vent. This regulation is also applied to all stoves fitted to properties built from 2008 onwards. Our installer will advise further on completion of a site survey.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading marginless">Carbon monoxide detectors.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector, with alarm, with every solid fuel heating appliance. This operation will also be covered with you at the end of the installation process during the commissioning process.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading marginless">HETAS.</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-foot">The HETAS body sets guidelines to ensure that installations are carried out competently and to the standards required for the safe running of your stove. All installations should be performed by a registered engineer who has completed the relevant HETAS training and can show you their valid registration certificate or card.</p>
